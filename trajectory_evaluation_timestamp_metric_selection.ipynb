    "##### Effect of merge function\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, for the \"good\" trajectories (`easiest` and `backtracking`), the merge function has essentially no effect. The trajectories are so good that the tolerance is less than 10 meters and using the midpoint versus random versus closest makes no difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the other two, choosing the closest point allows us to handle the case where the errors are related primarily to one phone (e.g. in the `weird_android` case). So if the iOS trajectory is good (as determined by a comparison with spatial ground truth), we can use it directly and not have it be polluted by the bad android trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "So effectively, with this approach, we are choosing the good points from each of the trajectories and stitching them together to create an overall trajectory. This implies that we cannot use an inner join for the merge, since then we would only retain points that were good in **both** trajectories. We use an outer join instead, and if there are points that are good only in one trajectory, we just select them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this allows us to use much smaller thresholds and still get coverages similar to the higher thresholds while using midpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "However, stitching together points from multiple trajectories is challenging if there are time sychronization issues. While the timestamps for a single phone are guaranteed to be consistent, timestamps across phones are not guaranteed to be consistent, and flip flopping between phones can lead to zigzags in the final trajectories. For example, in the `weird_android` case, see:\n",
