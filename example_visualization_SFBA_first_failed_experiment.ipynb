To make this easier, we want to switch the view so that the calibration ranges are first grouped by the settings and then by the phone.

We would expect power drain of the evaluation (which duty cycles the sensing) to be much lower than the accuracy control, which senses continuously. However, both the evaluation phones ran out of battery before the second trip, and the accuracy control did not. Let's verify this from the battery drain.\n",

The power drain of both regimes is almost identical to the power control, although we would expect the power control to get even lower when we actually stop tracking.

Given that the sensing is largely identical, this **must be** due to the additional processing of iterating over all the entries to determine whether the trip has ended.
